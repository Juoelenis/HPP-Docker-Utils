# HPP + Docker
**HPA Progress Plexus + Docker: WWW Alternative available now for Docker**

The "HPA Progress Plexus + Docker" project breathes new life into the world of legacy web applications by leveraging the power of modern containerization. Designed to bridge the gap between the nostalgia of the early web era and today's cutting-edge technology, this project enables developers to seamlessly deploy, scale, and manage old-school web applications with Docker containers.

At its core, the HPA Progress Plexus combines the Progress technology (a nod to the past) with the flexibility and scalability of Docker. This combination creates an environment where vintage web applications, often built with older frameworks or software stacks, can run efficiently on contemporary infrastructure without requiring extensive rewrites or migrations.

Key Features:
- **Revival of Legacy Web Apps:** Runs and deploys older web technologies that may have been left behind in the fast-paced world of modern software development.
- **Docker-Optimized Containers:** Uses Docker containers to isolate, package, and deploy applications in a portable, consistent manner.
- **Scalable via HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaling):** Supports dynamic scaling based on load, ensuring legacy applications remain performant under varying traffic conditions.
- **Simplicity and Efficiency:** Offers a streamlined deployment process, reducing operational complexity while ensuring compatibility across diverse environments.

In essence, HPA Progress Plexus + Docker represents a forward-thinking solution to ensure that the valuable lessons and experiences of the "old interwebs" can continue to thrive in the modern digital landscape, all while enjoying the benefits of Docker's efficiency and flexibility.
